# odxny: I won't lie, I'm a little impressed.

# MC: how so?

# odxny: Managing to get incri to be anything close to helpful is quite a feat

# odxny: Have to give props where it's due.

# [1] MC: about time!!

# odxny: You can't hear it but I'm clapping for you.

# MC: well now it just feels sardonic

# odxny: I'll stop the clapping then.

# MC: no keep doing that

# odxny: As you wish.

# [2] MC: it was a struggle but we got there

# odxny: We will never forget your sacrifice.

# MC: do I get a medal? or a plaque?

# odxny: I can send you enough money for a commemorative sandwich.

# MC: two sandwiches?

# odxny: Deal.

# // end choices 

# MC: did you message just to congratulate me tho?

# odxny: Well, partially. Felt a bit awkward to do so in the main chat.

# odxny: But I was also wondering if you wanted to call again.

# MC: oh?

# odxny: Just to chat. No vetting this time.

# MC: no insults?

# odxny: Depends.

# odxny: I'll try to refrain, though.

# MC: i'll accept that risk, then

# odxny: Excellent.
